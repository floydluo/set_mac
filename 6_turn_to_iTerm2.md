## 6. Turn to iTerm2

As mentioned above, install it by:

`$ brew install iterm2`

iTerm2 is a great substitute of Mac's own terminal. If you dip into it and master it, you will improve your work efficiency,

In defaults, the terminal is a bash shell. But we can change the shell to zsh.

There is a easy way, that is installing `oh-my-zsh`.

By:

`sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`

Then you will notice your iTerm2 is changed a lot.

You can also change your iTerm2's theme in the file `'.zsh'`
